Base statements:
- Aspects (selector = value)
    - Primitives
    - Objects
    - Build-time expressions
- Functions (name, args with types (including possibly selectors) = expression)
- Event listeners
    - Direct listener (selector name -> event args with types ("this" is implicit), list of events to trigger)
    - Indirect (subtree) listener (same as above but with =>)

Expressions:
- Within context of a function, args can be used as-is
- New selectors, or selector literals, can be used by surrounding with special syntax (square brackets?)
- Way to restrict the selection scope of a function?
    - By putting between curly braces?
